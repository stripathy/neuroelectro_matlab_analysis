Description: Data analysis scripts for processing and analyzing biophysical data from NeuroElectro (www.neuroelectro.org) based on summarized spreadsheets output by the NeuroElectro API (http://www.neuroelectro.org/api/docs/)

The code (written in Matlab) for running analyses and generating figures from paper are
primarily contained in file: ephys_fig_gen_runfile.m, which is a script file
that calls additional functions and scripts to generate figures.

Run the code in ephys_fig_gen_runfile.m block by block to generate analyses and figures.

Potential dependencies:
statistics toolbox, bioinformatics toolbox, matlab 2013+
